- We should split the work into: Petri net, geometry, and 3D visualization
- We do not need to revise the project definition, but to take the notes into account for the System Specification

- It is important the experiment, to eliminate the risk => Focus into the 3D
	- Set 2/3 persons to work ONLY and ONLY on the 3D
	
- UML diagrams have to be submitted in 2 weeks, drafts should already be done (class diagram only?)
