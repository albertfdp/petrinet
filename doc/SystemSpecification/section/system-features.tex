\section{System Features}
\label{sec:system-features}

In this section, the main features of the components will be discussed, as well as possible features that may be implemented in future releases of the product.
The main functionalities needed by each component in order for the project to work will be discussed into more detail. \newline
The main use cases of the system components are also provided in each subsection in order to describe how the system will be used by the final user. 

\subsection{Conventions}

The priority of the requirements in Section \ref{sec:system-features} and \ref{sec:non-functional} will be indicated by the keywords \textbf{shall}, \textbf{should} and \textbf{would be nice}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Shall}: Requirements that must be implemented as a minimum; resources must be allocated to these requirements.
	\item \textbf{Should}: Requirements that add more functionality to the software, but are not the core required to work; if possible, resources will be allocated.
	\item \textbf{Would be nice}: Requirements considered good ideas and would be implemented if there are sufficient resources or in later versions of the software.
\end{itemize}
