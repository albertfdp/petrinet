\subsection{Configuration Editor}
\writer{Albert}

The configuration editor is a component that will work as a connector between the Petri net editor (Section \ref{sec:sf-petrinet}), the Geometry editor (Section \ref{sec:sf-geometry}) and the Appearance editor (Section \ref{sec:sf-appearance}). 

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The configuration editor \textbf{shall} allow the user to input a Petri net file containing its model.
	\item The configuration editor \textbf{shall} allow the user to input a Geometry file containing its model.
	\item The configuration editor \textbf{shall} allow the user to input an Appearance file containing its model.
	\item The configuration editor \textbf{shall} allow the user to start a simulation with the referenced Petri net, Geometry and Appearance models.
	\item It \textbf{would be nice} if the configuration editor allows the user to validate the data.
	\item It \textbf{would be nice} if the configuration editor to save and load a specific configuration to a file.
\end{enumerate}
