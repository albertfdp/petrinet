\section{Known issues and bugs}

This section enumerates all the bugs that have been found or the features that due to time have not been able to accomplish. These are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Textures and 3D models for tracks and switches could not be done.
	\item Collision detection for multiple lines.
	\item It is not possible to launch two instances of the 3D engine at once. This is due to technical limitations from the JMonkey Engine.
	\item There is a known issue when resetting the simulation. The camera stops being able to be moved after pressing reset, even the rest of the simulation works fine.
\end{itemize}
