The Configuration Editor consists of only one class that links Petri net with its Geometry and Appearance.
In order to link them, the Configurator class contains references to all the above mentioned classes. 

Figure \ref{fig:uml-configuration-editor} shows the simple model behind the Configuration Editor and how all the information is gathered in order to run the simulation.
