\subsection{Geometry editor}
\writer{Mikko}

The Geometry editor is the component used to define lines and points in two dimensional plane which will then define the shape of the visualized simulation. Figure \ref{fig:model-geometry} describes the geometry model used by the Geometry Editor.

\paragraph{Geometry}
The Geometry class is an abstract definition of a geometry object.

\paragraph{GObject}
The GObject is a geometry object, which can be either a line or a point. It has attributes \textbf{name} and \textbf{id}. \textbf{name} is used to name individual geometry objects, so that user can easily tell them apart. \textbf{id} is used to differentiate geometry objects from each other.

\paragraph{Point}
Point is a location in the two dimensional plane. It has attributes \textbf{xLocation} and \textbf{yLocation} which refer to the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively.

\paragraph{InputPoint}
Class InputPoint refers to objects that will be clickable for the user in the 3D simulation. 

\paragraph{Connector}
Class Connector is either the beginning or the ending point of a line. Therefore, lines that end at a Connector are \textbf{in} and lines that start from a Connector are \textbf{out}.

\paragraph{BendPoint}
Class BendPoint is the type of point that will be used to turn straight lines into curved ones.

\paragraph{Line}
Class Line is a parametric curve in a two dimensional plane. The line begins at a point location \textbf{begin} and it ends at a point location \textbf{end}. A \textbf{BendPoint} is a point location which defines the curve of the line, unless it doesn't have one, thus the line would be straight.
