\section{Non functional requirements}
In addition to programming related requirements, number of requirements is identified in the following sections.
=======
\label{sec:non-functional}

\subsection{Implementation constraints}
The software must be implemented as plug-in to the Eclipse framework. The software is based on following technologies:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Eclipse Modeling Framework, EMF v. 2.91
	\item Graphical Modeling Framework, GMF 3.91
	\item Graphical Editing Framework, GEF 1.70
	\item JMonkey v. 3.0
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Documentation}
Development must be documented and documentations must be delivered according to following delivery deadlines
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Project definition, week 39
	\item UML diagrams, week 41
	\item System specification, week 44
	\item Handbook, draft, 47
	\item Test documentation, 51
	\item Final documentation, 51
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Quality Assurance}
Procedures insuring the quality of this software project are presented in the following segment.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Quality of documentation
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Each part of the document is produced by multiple persons to decrease amount of typical errors.
		\item Each part of documentation is reviewed for feedback. Depending on feedback appropriate measures are taken to edit the documentation.
		\item Internal deadlines for documentation are set couple days in advance to the real deadline to give time to make feedback.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Quality of implementation
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Each implementation is produced by multiple persons to decrease amount of typical errors.
		\item Commenting on manually generated code shall use javadoc standard.
		\item A test strategy shall be developed to test the implementation. The strategy consists of unit test, acceptance test and system testing. Manually made code should have good results with these tests.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
