The 3D Simulator will show the animated Petri net, while allowing the user to play/pause the simulation, the camera perspective of the simulation and interact withinput points. The functionality of the 3D simulator can be specified using the following statements.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to start the simulation.
\item The Simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to pause the simulation.
\item The Simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to reset the simulation.
\item The Simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to add tokens on input places by interaction with the 3D animation.
\item The Simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to exit the simulation.
\item The Simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to change the perspective of the view.
\item It \textbf{would be nice} if the Simulator allowed the user to take screenshots.
\item It \textbf{would be nice} if the Simulator allowed the user to forward the simulation.
\item It \textbf{would be nice} if the Simulator allowed the user to rewind the simulation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Use cases}

The features described above are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:use-cases-simulator}.
