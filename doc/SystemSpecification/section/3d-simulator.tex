\subsection{3D Simulator}
\label{sec:sf-simulator}
The functionality of the 3D simulator can be specified using the following statements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to play the simulation.
\item The simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to pause the simulation.
\item The simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to reset the simulation.
\item The simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to add tokens on input places.
\item The simulator \textbf{shall} allow the user to exit the simulation.
\item The simulator \textbf{should} allow the user to change the orientation of the view.
\item It \textbf{would be nice} if the simulator allowed the user to take screenshots.
\item It \textbf{would be nice} if the simulator allowed the user to forward the simulation.
\item It \textbf{would be nice} if the simulator allowed the user to rewind the simulation.
\end{enumerate}
