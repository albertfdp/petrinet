\subsection{jMonkey}

The jMonkeyEngine 3.0 provides libraries that ease the implementation process. When visualizing the paths defined in the configuration file, a jMonkey class is used. The class has a waypoint system with different types of smoothing available for use. This waypoint system integrates natively with another jMonkey class that is used to animate objects along paths. The animation system lets the program play, pause and reset the animation of objects along the path. Also, the current position and play state of the animation is always available. These functions are essential to the simulator, and saves time in the implementation process. Other examples of less essential functions are: real time camera control, keyboard input mapping and listeners, physics simulation and collision detection.
