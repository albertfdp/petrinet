\section{Architecture}
\writer{Albert and Monica}
The architecture of this \epns has been designed as modular, meaning that the system is divided in different components which are connected through interfaces. In this way, components are independent of each other and can be developed by different members of the team. In addition, the modular design is an advantage for easily testing each component as well as the entire system in a hierarchical structure.
